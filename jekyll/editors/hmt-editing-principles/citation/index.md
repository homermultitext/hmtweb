Scholarly material must be *canonically citable*.    Canonical citation practice uses identifiers that are independent of any specific representation, and can identify either a *notional object* or a *concrete version* of an object in such a way that different versions of an object are explicitly identified as referring to a common notional object.

Any form of canonical citation implies a model of the object it identifies.  The Homer Multitext project uses two forms of canonical citation.


## Citing texts


In citing texts, we follow the OHCO2 model of texts as an **o**rdered **h**ierarchy of **c**itation **o**bjects.


## Citing objects

All other scholarly references are cited following the CITE2 model of *unique objects* in *versioned collections*.
