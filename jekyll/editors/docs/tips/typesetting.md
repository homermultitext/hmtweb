- ["Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient"](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html). A classic essay on why you should use a text editor and something like Markdown.
- [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net). An online editor. Write Markdown. Export to PDFs. Include crazy LaTeX stuff if you want.
- ["The Beauty of LaTeX"](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex). LaTex is what scientists and mathematicians use; it is capable of stunning typography like nothing you can get by any other means. It is crazy complicated, but these days you can do most of your work in Markdown and still get the benefits.  Blackwell will be happy to have this conversation with you.
