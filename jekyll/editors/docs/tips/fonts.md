- [The Greek Font Society](http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces18th.html). Beautiful, historically researched Greek typefaces, awesomely organized by century, openly licensed. You particularly want to check out Porson, which is what the Oxford Classical Texts use, and Gazis, which has a very nice "Textus Receptus of Robert Ã‰tienne" vibe.
- [Gentium](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=gentium). Bringing harmony to the world by making a free font with a very complete coverage of Unicode.
