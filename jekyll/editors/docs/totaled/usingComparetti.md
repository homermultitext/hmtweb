title: Using the Comparetti facisimile
layout: page
---


## Background ##


In 1901, Domenico Comparetti produced a 1:1 facsimile of the manuscript.  In 2007, the HMT project took high-resolution photography of the manuscript, including some UV light shots for selected pages or regions of pages.  The HMT project has also digitized the Comparetti facsimile, so that you compare the photography of the Venetus A as it was in 2007 with the evidence of Comparetti's photography of the manuscript in 1901.

Consider two examples

1. Folio [192 recto as it appeared in 2007](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA192RN-0363&request=GetIIPMooViewer)
2. Folio [192 recto in the digital image Comparetti's 1901 photograph](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?urn=urn:cite:hmt:compimg.Comparetti_192recto205&request=GetIIPMooViewer)


## To use Comparetti images as you are editing

1. Go to: <http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/>
2. Select `Look up material by urn` 
3. Under `Find links to...` and 	`other objects`, enter the object urn for your folio (e.g. `urn:cite:hmt:msA.12r`).
4. What do you get?
	- default image
	- additional regular light images
	- the Comparetti facsimile
	- any available special light images or close ups


If there is fading:

1. Always index citable texts to the default image in your main indexing file (even if you can not see anything).
2. Add a secondary index to  any other images that offer better visuals in:  `collections/venA-secondaryimages.csv`.
