title: Installing sbt
---

We validate our editorial work using programs written in Scala.  You don't need to install Scala separately, however.  We'll use the simple build tool, `sbt`, to find code libraries automatically, including Scala.

To install sbt :

-   First install a full Java JDK (software development kit).  (Note that this is different from Java plugins for your web browser, which you may already have installed.)  You can find a  JDK for your operating system at <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>
-   Download and install sbt from <http://www.scala-sbt.org/>  (OS X users: if you download the `zip` or `tgz` file, make sure `sbt/bin` is on your CLASSPATH.)
