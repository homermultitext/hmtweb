Your newly installed VM will have a single English (US) keyboard layout.  To add a polytonic Greek keyboard, first open System Settings (the far-right icon on your dock).  Open "Keyboard", and choose the "Layout" tab.  Click the "+" sign at the lower left to add a new keyboard layout.  For Greek be sure that you set the language to Greek, and the layout to polytonic, like this:

![choose polytonic](../imgs/configure-polytonic-elementary.png)

At the top right corner of your window, you should now see a menu item with a list of installed keyboard layouts, like this:




![multiple keyboards installed](../imgs/multikeyboards.png)

You can cycle through your installed keyboards with the keyboard shortcut `alt-space`.


Repeat this to add any other keyboard layouts you would like to use.
