Git is the version control system we use for the HMT project.





## Installing `git`

If you're running a version of Mac OS newer than 10.7.5, install git by going to <https://git-scm.com/>.


If you're running Mac OS X 10.7.5:

- download Git 1.8.4.2 from [this page](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/detail?name=git-1.8.4.2-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg&can=2&q=), and run the installer
-  When the installation is done, close your Terminal window and open another one.
- Confirm that it works by typing `git --version`.
