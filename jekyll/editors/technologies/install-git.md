Git is the version control system we use for the HMT project.

## If you're running Mac OS X 10.7.5


- Go to [this page](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/detail?name=git-1.8.4.2-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg&can=2&q=) and download Git 1.8.4.2
- Run that installer. When it is done, close your Terminal window and open another one.
- Confirm that it works by typing `git --version`.
