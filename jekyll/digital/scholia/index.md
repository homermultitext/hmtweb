## Instructions

You can search the *scholia* using any combination of:


- a string search on a diplomatic text in lower case, with all accents and breathings stripped
- filtering *scholia* by critical signs on the associated *Iliad* line. Selecting more than one sign filters for lines including *all* the selected signs. Order is not taken into consideration: checking both obelos and asteriskos will match sequences of those two signs in any order.
- filtering results by presence of a numbered simile marker


If the scholion is correctly indexed to a line of the *Iliad* (nearly all are), the display of results includes the *Iliad* reference, and links to facsimile editions of the Venetus A manuscript .

> Note that characters falling outside the set allowed by current standards of the HMT project are displayed by Unicode numeric code point between ## characters. We are working to bring our edition up to a uniform standard.
