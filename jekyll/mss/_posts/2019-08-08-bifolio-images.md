[![Pages 230 verso - 231 recto of the Venetus B](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/hmt/vbbifolio/v1/vb_230v_231r.tif&RGN=0.01052,0.01404,0.9885,0.9858&wID=900&CVT=JPEG)](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vbbifolio.v1:vb_230v_231r@0.01052,0.01404,0.9885,0.9858)

The _scholia_ in the Venetus B and Escorial, Upsilon 1.1., manuscripts are laid out by bifolio spread, rather than the single-page design of manuscripts like the Venetus A.  The numbered _scholia_ begin with **α‘** (1) on each verso page, and continue without interruption from the end of the verso on to the facing recto side of the next folio.  (The image above of pages 230 verso - 231 recto of the Venetus B manuscript is linked to a zoomable image if you want to see an example in more detail.)  For this reason, we therefore want to use citable images not of single pages but of bifolio spreads as we begin to edit these manuscripts.

Photographs of bound manuscripts, on the other hand, must be taken one page at a time:  opening a bifolio spread flat enough to photograph both pages simultaneously would dangerously stress the manuscript's binding.  Thanks to contributions from many project members, we have already created composite images of hundreds of bifolio spreads from our single-page images of the Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1 manuscripts.  We are making those images available in a simple facsimile browser similar to [the browser we introducted last year for the Venetus A manuscript](http://www.homermultitext.org/tech/2018-10-20-facsimiles/).

You can find browsable images for both manuscripts at
<http://www.homermultitext.org/digital/>.  Images are linked to the HMT Image Citation Tool, which allows you to pan and zoom the high-resolution images, as well as canonically cite regions of an image with URNs.
