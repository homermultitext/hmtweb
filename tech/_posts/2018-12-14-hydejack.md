title: New site design
---


We're experimenting with a new web site design, based entirely on content written in Markdown.  It uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the web site, with the [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) theme.

The Homer Multitext project is a large and complex collaboration. We hope that we'll be able to use this platform to integrate more of the varied material (including news and announcments, technical documentation, and end-user apps) from the single <http://www.homermultitext.org> starting point.
