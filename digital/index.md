## Digital editions

The Homer Multitext project publishes its  digital editorial work in three forms.  In descending order of priority, they are:

1.  *Downloadable data sets* in the plain-text Cite Exchange (CEX) format.  These are always available from the `releases-cex` directory of our archival repository on github, <https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive>.
2.  *A network service*.  We serve a current published release of HMT data using [CITE Services](https://github.com/cite-architecture/scs-akka).
3.  *End-user applications*.
    -  An [image citation](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/) tool.
    - [hmt-digital](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/), an installation of the [generic CITE-App](https://github.com/cite-architecture/cite-app) configured to talk to the HMT network service.

## Binary image data
